### Fetching and pulling
---
When we clone a repo we also have a "**Remote Tracking Branch**" for example `origin/master`. It's a reference to the state of the master branch on the remote. You can't move this yourself. It's like a bookmark pointing to the last known commit on the master branch on origin.
**Remote Tracking Branches** - "At the time you last communicated with this remote repository, here is where x branch was pointing". They follow this pattern `<remote>/<branch>`, for example:
- `origin/master` references the state of the master branch on the remote repo named origin.
- `upstream/logoRedesign` references the state of the `logoRedesign` branch on the remote named upstream (a common remote name).
`git branch -r` - lists the remote branches our local repository knows about (using the `-r` flag).
When you for example make a new commit locally (on master), your master branch updates, like always, but the remote (`origin/master`) stays the same - it stays on the last known spot for `origin/master`. We can checkout these remote branch pointers, for example:
`git checkout origin/master` (detached HEAD) - we will see the state of the project when we last communicated with GitHub.

**Working with remote branches**:
Once you've **cloned a repository**, we have all the data and Git history for the project at that moment in time. However, that doesn't mean it's all in our workspace. For example the GitHub repo has a branch named `bugfix`, but when we run `git branch` we don't see it on our machine. All I we is the `master` branch. What's going on? When we use `git branch -r` we can see all these branches but with origin tracking reference for ex. `origin/bugfix`. By default (when we cone a repo), our `master` branch is already tracking `origin/main`, we didn't connect these ourselves. So, what to do if we want to work on the `bugfix` branch locally? We would use
`git checkout origin/bugfix` but that puts us in detached HEAD. We want our own local branch called `bugfix`, and we want it to be connected to `origin/bugfix`, just like our local `master` branch is connected to `origin/main`. To achieve this we run `git switch <remote-branch-name>` to create a new local branch from the remote branch of the same name. So, `git switch bugfix` makes us a local `bugfix` branch AND sets it up to track the remote branch `origin/bugfix`. The "old" way (before `git switch`) for the same functionality **using checkout** was slightly more complicated: `git chekout --track origin/<branch-name>`, so `git switch` simplifies it a lot.

**Fetching**:
When the remote repo has changed, for example has new commits (on GitHub), and our local repo doesn't know, to get those changes we can use `git fetch <remote>` - fetches branches and history from a specific remote repository. It only updates remote tracking branches. It allows us to download changes from a remote repository, BUT those changes will not be automatically integrated into our working files. It lets us see what others have been working on, without having to merge those changes into our local repo. Think of it as "please go and get the latest information from GitHub, but don't screw up my working directory".  Also, we can fetch a specific branch from a remote using `git fetch <remote> <branch>`, for ex. `git fetch origin master` would retrieve the latest information from the master branch on the origin remote repository.
Now, when we fetch we can view the changes/commits that are "ahead" of our branch tip using
`git checkout origin/<branch-name>` (detached HEAD).

**Pulling**:
`git pull` is another command that we can use to retrieve changes from a remote repository. Unlike fetch, pull actually updates our HEAD branch with whatever changes are retrieved from the remote. Think of it as "go and download my data from GitHub AND immediately update my local repo with those changes". `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`. To pull, we specify the particular remote and branch we want to pull using `git pull <remote> <branch>`. Just like with
`git merge` it matters WHERE we run this command from. Whatever branch we run it from is where the changes will be merged into. For example `git pull origin master` would fetch the latest information from the origin's master branch and merge those changes into our current branch. Also, pulls can result in merge conflicts.
If we run `git pull` without specifying a particular remote or branch to pull from, Git assumes the following:
- remote will default to origin.
- branch will default to whatever tracking connection is configured for your current branch.
Note: this behavior can be configured, and tracking connections can be changed manually. Most people don't mess with that stuff.
