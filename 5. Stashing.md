### Stashing
---
When working on a project, it’s common to have unfinished or experimental changes that you don’t want to commit yet. These changes can include modified tracked files, staged changes, and even untracked files. `git stash` provides a way to temporarily shelf or “stash” these changes.
So, for example you have commits on master branch, then create and switch to another branch, you do some changes, add something - when you don't commit these changes and switch back to master there are two options on what will happen: **your changes come with you to the destination branch** (so in this case to the master branch) or **Git won't let you switch if it detects potential conflicts**.

`git stash` - saves changes that you are not yet ready to commit. It will take all uncommitted changes (staged and un-staged) and stash them, reverting the changes in your working copy. You can also use `git stash save`.
`git stash pop` - removes the most recently stashed changes in your stash and re-apply them to your working copy.

Git provides an easy way of stashing these uncommitted changes so that we can return to them later, without having to make unnecessary commits. So, when you don't want to commit yet on some branch and change to another branch you can use `git stash` to "save" the current changes without committing.

`git stash apply` - applies whatever is stashed away, without removing it from the stash. This can be useful if you want to apply stashed changes to multiple branches.

You can add multiple stashes onto the stack of stashes. They will be stashed in the order you added them.
`git stash list` - lists stashes. It will show you on which branch and commit the work in progress/stashed changes are, also it will show you which stash it is, for ex. `stash@{2}`, then you can specify which stash you want to apply using: `git stash apply stash@{<stash-id>}`.

`git stash drop stash@{<stash-id>}` - deletes a particular stash.
