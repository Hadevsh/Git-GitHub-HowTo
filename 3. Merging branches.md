### Merging branches
---
Incorporate changes from one branch into another, using branch merging.
We **merge branches not specific commits** and we **always merge to the current HEAD branch**.

To merge we need to (fast forward merge):
1. Switch to or checkout the branch you want to merge the changes into (the receiving branch).
2. Use the **git merge** command to merge changes from a specific branch into the current branch (we are on).
A fast forward merge means that for ex. the master branch has some number of commits and the second branch goes the other way or splits on the last commit (on the master branch), we use a fast forward merge (second branch to the master branch) assuming there is no other commits on the master branch. In easy word - the master branch "fast forwards" and "picks up" to the other branch since it doesn't have these commits. **Not all merges are fast forward merges!**

`git merge <branch-name>` - merges the branch with the specified name to the branch you are currently on.

**Merging a branch does not delete the branch you merged to another branch**, you can still add features to this branch. You will have both branches.

If for example the branch you are merging to is ahead of where the other branch was split, or in other words, for ex. there is new information on the master branch that the bugfix branch doesn't have, we sometimes cannot perform a fast forward merge because we could end up with a merge conflict - for ex. new commit on branch master that the bugfix branch does not have edited the same line as the commit on the bugfix branch.
So, rather than performing a simple fast forward merge, Git performs a "merge commit". We end up with a new commit on the master branch (git will prompt you for a message), also this new commit has two parent commits instead of one.

For the merge commit you should use a `-m` flag to specify a message for  the commit that will be created:  `git merge <branch-name> -m "Merge branch message"`
When you encounter a merge conflict, Git **warns you in the console that it could not automatically merge**:
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in blah.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
**It also changes the contents of your files to indicate the conflicts that it wants you to resolve**.

So, **resolving conflicts**:
1. Open up the file(s) with merge conflicts.
2. Edit the file(s) to remove the conflicts. Decide which branch's content you want to keep in each conflict or keep the content from both.
3. Remove the conflict "markers" in the document, that Git has added.
4. Add your changes and then make a commit!
To resolve conflicts using **VS Code**, you can click to accept current or incoming change on the top of he file.

Exercise for this section is in:
`Playlist/` folder in `C:\Users\Error\Desktop\Stuff\Udemy\Git & GitHub`
- This exercise is a little bit different - it doesn't have specific instructions (but does have requirements).
