### Git tags
---
We use tags to mark important moments in history. Tags are pointers that refer to particular in Git history. We can mark a particular moment in time with a tag. Tags are most often used to mark version releases in projects (v4.1.0, v.4.1.1, etc.). Think of tags as branch references that do NOT CHANGE. Once a tag is created, it always refers to the same commit. It's just a label for a commit.

There are two types of Git tags we can use: lightweight and annotated tags:
- **lightweight tags** are... lightweight. They are just a name/label that points to a particular commit.
- **annotated tags** store extra meta data including the author's name and email, the date, and tagging message (like a commit message).

Semantic versioning spec outlines a standardized versioning system for software releases. It provides a consistent way for developers to give meaning to their software releases. Versions consist of three numbers separated by periods. Detailed set of rules for semantic versioning can be found on [semver](https://semver.org/).

`git tag` - prints a list of tags in the current repository.
We can **search for tags** that match the particular pattern by using `git tag -l` and then passing in a wildcard pattern. For example, `git tag -l "*beta*"` will print a list of tags that include "beta" in their name.
To **view the state of a repository** at a particular tag, we can use `git checkout <tag>`, this puts us in detached HEAD.

`git tag <tag-name>` - creates a lightweight tag, by default Git will create a tag referring to the commit that HEAD is referencing.
`git tag -a <tag-name>` - creates an annotated tag with the `-a` flag. Git will then open your default text editor and prompt you for additional information. Similar to `git commit`, we can also use the `-m` flag to pass a message directly.
We can tag an **older commit** using `git tag <tag-name> <commit>` (for a lightweight tag, or with `-a` flag for an annotated tag), we can also use `<commit-hash>`.
Git will yell at us if we try to reuse a tag that is already referring to a commit. If we use the `-f` flag, we can FORCE our tag through.
`git tag -d <tag-name>` - deletes a tag.
`git show <tag-name>` - prints more information for a specified tag (mostly for annotated tags).

By default, `git push` doesn't transfer tags to remote servers. If you have  a lot of tags that you want to push at once, you can use the `--tags` flag to the `git push` command. This will transfer all of your tags to the remote server that are not already there.
