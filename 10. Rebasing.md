### Rebasing
---
There are two main ways to use **rebase** in Git: as an alternative to merging or as a cleanup tool.

So, let's say I'm working on a collaborative project, and I make a feature branch, I do some work on the branch, but lets say someone did some work and merged it to the master branch so now master has new work on it, my feature branch doesn't have this work! So, I merge master into feature which results in a new merge commit, and after someone has made new changes again, I have to merge again, and so on. The feature branch has a bunch of merge commits. If the master branch is very active, my feature branch's history is muddied. We can instead rebase the feature branch onto the master branch. This moves the entire feature branch so that it BEGINS at the tip of the master branch. All of the work is still there, but **we have re-written history**. Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history by **creating new commits** for each of the original feature branch commits. We can also wait utile we are done with a feature and then rebase the feature branch onto the master branch. To **rebase**:
1. `git switch feature`
2. `git rebase master`
	 - `git rebase <branch-to-rebase-to>`
Also, we can simply use rebase instead of merging.

**Why rebase**? We get a much cleaner project history. No unnecessary merge commits. We end up with a linear project history.

**Important notes and WARNINGS**: 
- Never rebase commits that have been shared with others. if you have already pushed commits up to GitHub DO NOT rebase them unless you are positive no one on the team is using those commits. **You do not want to rewrite any history that other people already have. It's a pain to reconcile the alternate histories!**
- As always, when rebasing as well as in merging can end up with **conflicts**. Git runs you through the steps of resolving conflicts, as it's a little bit different than basic merge conflicts, just follow the output instructions.

We can also **clean up history with interactive rebase**, we can for example rewrite, delete, rename or even reorder commits (before sharing them). Running `git rebase` with the `-i` flag will enter the interactive mode, which allows us to edit commits, add files, drop commits, etc. Note that we need to specify how far back we wat to rewrite commits. Also, notice that we are not rebasing onto another branch. Instead, we are rebasing a series of commits onto the HEAD they currently are based on, for ex. `git rebase -i HEAD~4` to go back 4 commits from HEAD, after running this command, our text editor will open up - we'll see a list of commits alongside a list of commands that we can choose from. Here are a couple of the more commonly used commands:
- **pick** - use the commit
- **reword** - use the commit, but edit the commit message
- **edit** - use commit, but stop from amending
- **fixup** - use commit contents but meld it into previous commit and discard the commit message
- **drop** - remove commit
