### Adding and committing
---
`git init` - creates and initializes a git repo.

When creating a new project - you want a new history etc. before using `git init` always check `git status`, also you initialize only once, when you're creating the project, do not initialize again for ex. on a new coding session. Remember to **do not initialize a repo inside of a repo!**

The basic Git workflow:
1. **Work on stuff**: make new files, edit files, delete files etc.
2. **Add changes**: group specific changes together, in prep for committing.
3. **Commit**: commit everything that was previously added.

*Working directory* -> `git add` -> *Staging area* -> `git commit` -> *Repository*

**Staging area** - a file, generally contained in Git repository (.git) that stores information about what will go into the next commit.

`git add <file/files>` - adds files to the staging area.
`git add .` - stage all files at once.

`git commit -m "Commit message"` - Commits to the repo with a message. The commit message should summarize the changes made to the project.

Exercise for this section is in:
`Shopping/` folder in `C:\Users\Error\Desktop\Stuff\Udemy\Git & GitHub`

### Commits in detail (and related topics)
----------------------------------------------------
**Atomic commits** - when possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, change, or fix. In other words try to keep each commit focus on a single thing.

Commit messages should be written in present-tense imperative style: 
Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. `"make xyzzy do frotz"` instead of  
`"[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz"` or `"I changed xyzzy to do frotz"`, as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior.

`git log --oneline` - shorthand for `--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit` used together - shows one line of each commit message and instead of showing the full commit object name, shows a prefix that names the object uniquely.

**Amending commits**, suppose you just made the commit and then realized you forgot to include a file, or maybe you did a typo in the commit message that you want to correct.
Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can "redo" the previous (only the previous) commit using the `--amend` option:
- made a mistake and committed
- stage files you forgot etc.
- `git commit --amend`
- change the commit message in VS Code (editor)

**Ignoring files**, we can tell git which files and directories to ignore in a given repository, using a `.gitignore` file. This is useful for files you know you NEVER want to commit, including: secrets, **API keys**, **credentials**, etc., operating system files, **log files**, **dependencies** and **packages**. For example we include your API keys in a separate file, that we include in a `.gitignore` file, or we have files that are output by an application, or can be generated again (log/report files).
To use this functionality we need to create a `.gitignore` file in the root of a repository. Inside the file, we can write patterns to tell Git which files and folders to ignore:
- `.DS_Store` - will ignore files named .DS_Store
- `folderName/` - will ignore an entire directory
- `*.log` - will ignore any files with the `.log` extension
