### The basics of GitHub
---
GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. GitHub is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.

`git clone <repo-url>` - clones a repo (for ex. from GitHub). Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repository and will copy them to your local machine. In addition, Git initializes a new repository on your machine, giving you access to the full Git history of the coned project.

Before we can push anything up to GitHub, we need to tell Git about our remote repository on GitHub. We need to setup a "destination" to push up to. In Git, we refer to these "destinations" as remotes. Each remote is simply a URL where a hosted repository lives.

`git remote` or `git remote -v` - lists any existing remotes for your repository.
`git remote add <name> <url>` - adds a new remote to the specified URL repository.

`git remote add origin https://github.com/blah/repo.git` - Okay Git, anytime I use the name "origin", I'm referring to this particular GitHub repository.
**Origin?** It's a conventional Git remote name, but it's not at all special. It's just a name for a URL. When we clone a GitHub repo, the default remote name setup for us is called **origin**. You can change it using `git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>`. **Most people leave it**.

`git remote remove <name>` - removes the remote.

`git push <remote> <branch>` - pushes to the GitHub repository (using the remote), and which branch to push. For example `git push origin master` will push the branch **master** to the GitHub repository that is connected with the **origin** remote.

`git push -u origin master` - the `-u` option/flag allows us to **set the upstream of the branch we're pushing**. You can think of this as a link connecting out local branch to a branch on GitHub. Running `git push -u origin master` sets the upstream of the local master branch so that it tracks the master branch on the origin repo. This means that once we've set the upstream for a branch, we can use the `git push` shorthand which will **push our current branch to upstream**.

**Push in detail**, while we often want to push a local branch up to a remote branch of the same name, we don't have to - we ca use `git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>`. 
For example to push out local `pancake` branch up to a remote branch called `waffle` we could do: `git push origin pancake:waffle`. It's not common, but you can do it.

If you have an existing repository on your machine, and want to connect it to GitHub:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Connect your local repo (add remote).
3. Push up your changes to GitHub.
If you haven't begun work on your local repository, you can:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Clone it down to your machine.
3. Do some work locally.
4. Push up your changes to GitHub.
When you create a new repository on GitHub, it will show you all the steps and instructions so you can start your work - all these commands etc.

**Main and master** - GitHub default branch is main, **remember**.

Exercise for this section is in:
`favorites/` folder in `C:\Users\Error\Desktop\Stuff\Udemy\Git & GitHub`
- cloned repository (the repository on GitHub is deleted).
