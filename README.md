# Git & GitHub HowTo
Notes from a course about Git &amp; GitHub. These notes help to learn and understand key concepts of Git and how to connect it with GitHub.

These notes are all .md files, easy to view on GitHub. I also recommend installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a flexible writing app to view these files.
