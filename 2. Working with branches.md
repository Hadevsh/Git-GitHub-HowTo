### Working with branches
---
Every commit has a unique hash value

On large projects, we often work in multiple contexts:
1. You're working on two different color scheme variations for your website at the same time, unsure of which you like best.
2. You're also trying to fix a horrible bug, but it's proving tough to solve. You need to really hunt around a toggle some code on and off to figure it out.
3. A teammate is also working on adding a new chat widget to present at the next meeting. It's unclear if your company will end up using it.
4. Another coworker is updating the search bar autocomplete.
5. Another developer is doing an experimental radical design overhaul of the entire layout to present next month.
These things need to happen on separate contexts. That's why we use **branches** that are an essential part of Git. Think of branches as alternative timelines for a project. They enable us to create separate contexts where we can try new things, or even work on multiple ideas parallel.
**if we make changes on one branch, they do not impact or affect other branches** (unless we merge the changes).

The `master` branch is a default branch name, in Git we are always working on a branch. The branch **master** isn't special, it's just like any other branch.
Many people designate the master branch as their "official branch" for their codebase, but that is left to the developer to decide.

**Master? Main?**
In 2020, GitHub renamed the default branch name from **master** to **main**. The default Git branch name is still **master**, though the git team is exploring a potential change.
To **change the default branch name on git** you can use: 
`git config --global init.defaultBranch <branch-name>`

**A common workflow** is to work on a **master** branch, add for ex. an experimental or new feature on another branch and merge it back to the **master** branch. It's called feature branching. You can have multiple branches for any other features of course.

`HEAD` in `HEAD -> master` is simply a pointer that refers to the current "location" in your repository. It points to a particular branch reference. HEAD points to the tip (last commit) of the current branch.

`git branch` - view your existing branches. The `*` indicates the branch we are currently on.

`git branch <branch-name>` - creates a new branch based upon the current HEAD. This just creates a new branch, it **does not switch you to that branch**.
The branch name should not contain spaces, and it shouldn't be too long.

`git switch <branch-name>` - switch between branches.
`git switch -c <branch-name>` - creates a branch and switches to it automatically.

Another way of switching branches is to use `git checkout <branch-name>`, it still works but it does a million additional things, so the decision was made to add a standalone switch command which is much simpler. Probably a lot of tutorials and docs are using checkout instead of switch. Both now work. To create and switch automatically use `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.

`git -a -m "Commit message"` - commits all the changes without having to stage them earlier, it's like using `git add .` and then `git commit -m "Commit messages"` (cannot use on the first commit in the repository). You can also use flags `-am` to shorten it even more. 

Before switching branches make sure to commit all un-staged changes on the current branch.

`git branch -m <branch-name>` - renames a branch you are currently on.

`git branch -D <branch-name>` - deletes a branch with the specified name. You cannot delete the branch if you're currently on it (with force: `-D` = `--delete --force`).
