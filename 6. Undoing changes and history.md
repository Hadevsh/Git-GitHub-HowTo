### Undoing changes and history
---
The `git checkout` command for many developers is overloaded, which is what lead to the addition of the `git switch` and `git restore` commands. We can use **checkout** to create branches, switch to new branches, restore files, and undo history.

Remember, you can use `git log --oneline` command to view commit hashes. We just need the first 7 digits of a commit hash.
We can use `git checkout <commit-hash>` to view a previous commit, and we will get a message that tells us that we are in 'detached HEAD' state:
```
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental 
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
```
So what happened? Usually, HEAD points to a specific branch reference rather than a particular commit. When we checkout a particular commit, **HEAD points at that commit** rather than at the branch pointer (tip of the branch) - that's when the detached HEAD occurs.
It's not a bad thing that the HEAD is detached, you have couple of options:
- stay in detached HEAD to examine the contents of the old commit. Poke around, view files etc.
- leave and go back to whenever you were before - reattach the HEAD.
- create a new branch and switch to it. You now can make and save changes, since HEAD is no longer detached.

`git checkout` supports a slightly odd syntax for referencing previous commits relative to a particular commit. `HEAD~1` refers to the commit before HEAD (parent), `HEAD~2` refers to two commits before HEAD (grandparent), and so on.

**Discarding changes with checkout** - suppose you've made some changes to a file but don't want to keep them. To revert the file back to whatever it looked like when you last committed, you can use `git checkout HEAD <file-name>` to discard any changes in that file, reverting back to HEAD. 
**Another option to discard changes** or to revert a file - rather than typing HEAD, you can substitute `--` followed by the file(s) you want to restore: `git checkout -- <file-name>`.

**Un-modifying with restore** - `git restore` is a brand new Git command that helps with undoing operations. because it is so new, most of the existing Git tutorial and books do not mention it, but it is worth knowing. Recall that `git checkout` does a million different things, which many Git users find very confusing. `git restore` was introduced alongside `git switch` as alternatives to some uses for **checkout** to avoid confusion.
So, suppose you've made some changes to a file since your last commit. You've saved the file but then realized you definitely do NOT want those changes anymore (**if you have uncommitted changes in the file, they will be lost**), to **restore the file to the contents in the HEAD**, use:
`git restore <file-name>` - restores using HEAD as the **default source**, but we can change that using `--source` option. For example `git restore --source HEAD~1 home.html` will restore the contents of home.html to its state from the commit prior to HEAD. You can also use a particular commit hash as the source.

**Un-staging with restore** - if you have accidentally added a file to your staging are with `git add` and you don't wish to include it in the next commit, you can use:
`git restore --staged <file-name>` to remove it from staging.

`git reset <commit-hash>` - **resets the repository back to a specific commit**. **The commits are gone** - the changes from these commits are still there (not staged, not committed). So, suppose you've just made a couple of commits on the master branch, but you actually meant to make them on a separate branch instead. If you want to **undo both commits AND the actual changes** in your files use `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` - deletes the commits to the point of the specified commit and the associated changes.

`git revert` is similar to `git reset` in that they bot "undo" changes, but they accomplish it in different ways. `git reset` actually moves the branch pointer backwards, eliminating commits. `git revert <commit-hash>` instead creates a brand new commit which reverses/undo's the changes from a commit, you will be prompted to enter a commit message.
**Which one to use?**
Both `git reset` and `git revert` help us reverse changes, but there is a significant difference when it comes to collaboration. **If you want to reverse some commits that other people already have on their machines, you should revert**. If you want to reverse commits that you haven't shared with others, use reset and no one will ever know.
