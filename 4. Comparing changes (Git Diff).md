### Comparing changes (git diff) 
---
We can use the **git diff** command to view the changes between commits, branches, files, our working directory, and more.
We often use git diff alongside commands like git status and git log, to get a better picture of a repository and how it has changed over time.

`git diff` - lists all the changes in our working directory that are NOT staged for the next commit.

**How to read diffs** (from top):
1. `diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt` - **compared files**, for each comparison, Git explains which files it is comparing. Usually this is two versions of the same file. Git also declares one file as "A" and the other as "B".
2. `index 72d1d5a..f2c8117 100644` - **file metadata**, you really don't need to care about the file metadata. The two first numbers are the hashes of the two files being compared. The last number is an internal file mode identifier.
3. `--- a/file.txt` - **markers**, file A and file B are each assigned a symbol, file A gets a minus
   `+++ b/file.txt`   sign (-), and file B gets a plus sign (+).
4. `@@ -3,4 +3,5 @@` - **chunks**, a diff won't show the entire contents of a file, but instead only
   `<file-content>`     shows portions or "chunks" that were modified. A chunk also includes
                   some unchanged lines before and after a change to provide some context.
5. `@@ -3,4 +3,5 @@` - **chunk header**, each chunk starts with a header, found between two `@@`'s. From file A, 4 lines are extracted, starting from line 3. From file B, 5 lines are extracted starting from line 3.
6. `<changes>` - every line that changed between the two files are marked with either a `-` or `+` symbol. Lines that begin with `-` come from file A. Lines that begin with `+` come from file B.

`git diff HEAD` - lists all changes in the working tree since your last commit.
`git diff --staged/--cached` - lists the changes between the staging area and our last commit. In other words "show me what will be included in my commit if I run `git commit` right now".

We can **view a specific file** by providing git diff with a filename, using:
`git diff HEAD <file-name>` or `git diff --staged/--cached <file-name>`

`git diff <branch1>..<branch2>` - lists the changes between the tips of one branch and another branch.
`git diff <commit-hash1>..<commit-hash2>` - lists the changes between one commit and another commit.
